    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>I am an Assistant Professor at SRM University-AP, where I work in the areas of machine learning, predictive modeling, and hybrid optimization. My research focuses on developing reliable and interpretable computational models for complex real-world systems, especially within finance and healthcare.</p>

    <p>I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University, where I specialized in neural architecture optimization and multi-criteria decision-making approaches for enhancing time-series forecasting accuracy. Prior to that, I worked in academic and research support roles, gaining hands-on experience in lab instruction, curriculum support, and student mentorship.</p>

    <p>My work continues to explore the balance between algorithmic performance and meaningful model interpretability, aiming to create systems that are technically strong and practically applicable.</p>
